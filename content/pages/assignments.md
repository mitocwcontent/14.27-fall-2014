End of Semester Project
-----------------------

Write an essay (8–10 pages) and deliver a presentation (30 minutes) on an e-commerce-related topic you think is interesting. I can imagine three types of projects (but there could be others.)

1.  Describe an online market or industry
    *   Offline antecedents.
    *   What's new / different.
    *   Economic issues-This discussion should be informed by economic models you see in this course or others.
2.  Ask a question, gather data, analyze data, and then answer your question.
    *   How does the time that an auction ends on eBay affect the revenue of the seller?
    *   What happened to newspaper circulation in a city when Craigslist entered that city?
3.  Give us a preponderance of useful facts.
    *   For example: How much price variation is there within titles for used books? Do the title's characteristics seem to matter? Does it vary across used book listing sites?
